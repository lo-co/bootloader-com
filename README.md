This codebase is intended to use with the NXP `blhost` tool.  In this instance, a Raspberry Pi 3B+ is used to communicate with an NXP RT685-EVK. 

## The Raspberry Pi

The Raspberry Pi is loaded with the latest version of Raspian, Bullseye.  This uses version 3.9 of Python and version 2.01 of the NXP SPSDK.
